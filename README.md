# My Cloud Computing Journey

## Introduction
Hello! My name is Jane Markov and this is my public portfolio documenting my journey to become a professional Cloud Engineer. I am a student of Blaze Koneski at Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje, but my primary focus and passion are in Cloud Computing. 
## My Goals

- To earn my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect - Associate certifications.
- To build a robust portfolio of hands-on projects.
- To secure my first remote Cloud Engineer role by the time I graduate.
